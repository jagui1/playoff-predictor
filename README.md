# Auth0 Angular Samples

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/auth0-samples/auth0-angular-samples.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/auth0-samples/auth0-angular-samples)

These samples demonstrate how to add authentication to an Angular application with Auth0, using [auth0-spa-js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js). Each folder contains a distinct application so that various Auth0 features can be viewed in isolation. You can read about these examples in our [Angular Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/angular2).
